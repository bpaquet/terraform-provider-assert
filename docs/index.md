## Assert Provider

The assert provider add a datasource to implement an `assert_equal` in terraform.

### But why?

Mainly for compliance. Imagine you have 3 ec2 instances configured in terraform, and you need
to be sure you have only these 3 instances running in your aws account.

```
resource "aws_instance" "instance1" {
  ...
}

resource "aws_instance" "instance2" {
  ...
}

resource "aws_instance" "instance3" {
  ...
}
```

You can validate there is no undeclared instance with:

```
data "aws_instances" "all" {
  filter {
    name   = "vpc-id"
    values = ["<your_vpc_id"]
  }
}

data "assert_equal" "no_undeclared_instances" {
  current  = sort(data.aws_instances.all.ids)
  expected = sort([aws_instance.instance1.id, aws_instance.instance2.id, aws_instance.instance3.id])
}
```

### What happen when the assertion fail

The terraform operation (`plan` or `apply`) will throw an error.
